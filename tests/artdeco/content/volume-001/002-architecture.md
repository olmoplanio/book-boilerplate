# Art Deco Architecture

Art Deco architecture married vertical emphasis with setbacks that produced a telescoping profile.

## Materials & Techniques

Steel frames enabled height; terracotta, polychrome tile, aluminum, and opaque structural glass added sheen.

## Iconic Examples

- Chrysler Building (NYC): stainless steel crown, automotive motifs
- Palais de Chaillot (Paris): monumental classicism streamlined
- Eastern Columbia Building (Los Angeles): turquoise faience + gold accents

## Urban Identity

Skyscrapers became brand totems for corporations; neon and spires signaled progress.
